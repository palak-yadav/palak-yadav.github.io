                    Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people. Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular. Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

                <p>
                    I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be. Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so. In 3 words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.

                <h2>Mark Twain</h2>
                <p>
                    If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. Courage is resisance to fear, not absence of fear. Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. Don't go around saying the world owes you a living; the world owes you nothing, it was here first. The best way to cheer yourself up is cheer somebody else.
